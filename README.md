# Personal Security
How to remain vigilant in a world full of security threats
## Capture events
- Wear a body camera in public and have it constantly recording to capture any events as needed for evidence to protect yourself
## Data Security
### Physical Locking
Lock your data in a safe place to ensure the data is kept integral - not deleted, destroyed or tampered with. Specifically a locked cabinet, server rack or locked metal drawer
### Data encryption
Keep your data encrypted to prevent access from unauthorised parties
### Share less
Share only what data is needed and maintain vigilance over your personal information so that it is not used by third parties to impersonate you, market to you, or target you. Don't willingly give away personal information
## Email Security
### Wildcard email addresses
Utilise wildcard email addresses to enable each correspondent or contact to have an address that is personalised to them. This way you can identify when that specific address has been passed on and possibly sold to a third party or a data breach may have occcured - if you recieved emails to that address which are not from the original sender. This also enables you to easily dispose of that specific personalised address and leave all other recipient addresses untouched.
